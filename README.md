Artemis is a financial company looking to work on their online security to improve their business
After getting a list of their sites vulnerabilities I identified them and developed some solutions to reduce and eliminate some of them 
Learning about the Maven dependency check was extremely helpful to learn how to effectively use
Many of the vulnerabilities could be mitigated through software updates to many of their systems
After alterations running a dependency check showed any neutralized threats
I will undoubtedly use Maven in the  future to effectively identify vulnerabilities 
In the future I could point to my ability to find and list security risks
